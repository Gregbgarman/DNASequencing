# DNASequencing



As a graduate of an exercise science program, I saw this app as on opportunity to combine both what I learned then and what I am learning currently as a computer science major.
The central dogma of biology is that DNA is transcribed into mRNA and mRNA is translated into protein (composed of amino acids). The program utilizes a single class to first 
convert a DNA string into an mRNA string, then the mRNA string is decoded into amino acid sequences using a hash table.
